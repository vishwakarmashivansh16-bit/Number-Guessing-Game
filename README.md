🎯 Magic Number Guessing Game (Streamlit)

This project is a simple and interactive Magic Number Guessing Game built using Python and Streamlit.
The application generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it with real-time feedback after each attempt.

The game uses Streamlit session state to maintain the magic number, number of attempts, and game status across interactions. The interface is styled with custom CSS, and visual effects like snow and balloons make the experience more engaging.

Once the correct number is guessed, the user can either play again or quit the game.
